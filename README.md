# World_Weather_Analysis
Provide travel destination cities and nearby hotels based on user input on weather preferences


## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to utilize Python, Pandas, and Google APIs to generate weather data around the world and map out a travel itinerary based on user's temperature preferences.  The itinerary map comes complete with four destination cities along with pop-up markers which will show the hotel, city, country, and current weather.
